Description: 
                    PyOpenCL lets you access GPUs and other massively parallel compute
                    devices from Python. It tries to offer computing goodness in the
                    spirit of its sister project `PyCUDA <http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda>`_:
        
                    * Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom, often
                      called
                      `RAII <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization>`_
                      in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and
                      crash-free code.
        
                    * Completeness. PyOpenCL puts the full power of OpenCL's API at
                      your disposal, if you wish.  Every obscure `get_info()` query and 
                      all CL calls are accessible.
        
                    * Automatic Error Checking. All CL errors are automatically
                      translated into Python exceptions.
        
                    * Speed. PyOpenCL's base layer is written in C++, so all the niceties
                      above are virtually free.
        
                    * Helpful and complete `Documentation <http://documen.tician.de/pyopencl>`_
                      as well as a `Wiki <http://wiki.tiker.net/PyOpenCL>`_.
        
                    * Liberal license. PyOpenCL is open-source under the 
                      `MIT license <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License>`_
                      and free for commercial, academic, and private use.
        
                    * Broad support. PyOpenCL was tested and works with Apple's, AMD's, and Nvidia's 
                      CL implementations.
        
                    Like PyOpenCL? (And perhaps use it for `bitcoin
                    <http://bitcoin.org>`_ mining?) Leave a (bitcoin) tip:
